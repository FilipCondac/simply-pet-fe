#Simply Pet (WIP) ðŸ§¨

Typescript, React, NextJS 13.4, TailwindCSS

This website was initially created by a colleague and I in University. This project was proposed as a business model with stakeholders identified. We have decided to recreate this project and revamp it with better tech, code quality and also better UI/UX!

This project helped me learn NextJS 13.4 new layout and data fetching and also Next-Auth!
